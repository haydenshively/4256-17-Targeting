the Cyborg Cats' Python 2.7 vision code for FRC Steamworks 2017

This generic code should work for any camera that provides a MJPEG stream over the network, and can be easily adapted for Python 3. It pushes data about the location of the gear peg to NetworkTables. Please just cite our work in a comment somewhere if you decide to use it. Thanks!

Please note that there is a section which can adjust a threshold using NetworkTable values from a LeapMotion controller. The LeapMotion code is located at https://github.com/haydenshively/LeapStick-Table
